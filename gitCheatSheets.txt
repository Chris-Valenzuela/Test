    Attempting to push files from home to Work GitHub

    Received files from Home Laptop via branch "HOME"

    Branches:

        Master - final
        HOME - push updated work from HOME Laptop

    Received from Home laptop. Will attempt to push to master 


'================ TESTING DONE =========================

Workflow:

        git add . -> add ALL(.) files from working DIR to staging area
        git commit -m "message" -> uploads the staging area to Locla REPO
        git push -> pushes it to the final Repo
        git checkout -b "name" -> is what I used to create the "HOME" branch then i pushd to that

        git clone -> command to target an existing repository and create a copy/clone of target:

            git init -> command creates a new Git repository. You can convert an existing project
                into a Git or initialize a new empty repository
            git remote add origin  <REMOTE_URL> - Sets the new remote  (add the URL to that repository)
            git remote -v - Verifies the new remote URL
            git fetch (fetch all branches from that URL to your local repository)
            git checkout (create all the files of the main branch in your working tree)
        
        git branch - shows you what branches are avail and which you are in
            git checkout <name>
            git switch <existing_branch> 
            git switch -c <non_existing_branch> -If the destination branch does not exist, you have to specify the “-c” option (for “create branch“), otherwise you will get an error message when switching to that branch.
        
        mv file1 dir1 -> this moves file1 into dir1
        mv file1 file2 -> renames file1 to file2 
        type nul > example.txt - Create a new file specify type in command line 

    Work PC: 
        git pull origin HOME -> grabs data that has been pushed from user chritsv (home)
        git push origin master -> push data to "master" for: christsv to use 
    
    
    HOME PC:
        git pull origin MASTER -> grabs the latest data from the master (which was pushed by: chrisLRW)
        git push origin HOME -> pushes to "HOME" branch since (for some reason i.e no credentials not sure)
            I cant push to master from: christsv.
